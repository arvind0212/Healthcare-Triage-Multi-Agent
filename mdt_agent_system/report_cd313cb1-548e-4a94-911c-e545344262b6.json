      "raw_output": "**EHR Analysis Agent Report - Patient ID: MDT2024001**\n\n**1. Key History Points:**\n\n* **Chronological Progression of Symptoms:** The patient, a 62-year-old Caucasian female, presents with a persistent cough with occasional hemoptysis (blood-tinged sputum) since January 15th, 2024.  This is accompanied by significant unintentional weight loss (5kg in 3 months), fatigue, decreased appetite, and night sweats \u2013 all highly suggestive of an underlying malignancy.\n\n* **Medical History:**  The patient has a history of well-controlled Type 2 Diabetes (HbA1c 6.8%), well-controlled Hypertension (average BP 128/78), and Osteoarthritis affecting her knees and hands.  These comorbidities will need to be considered when planning treatment.  Her smoking history (former smoker, quit 10 years ago) represents a significant risk factor for lung cancer.\n\n* **Social and Functional Factors:** The patient is retired, suggesting potential availability for treatment but also potential limitations depending on the intensity of the regimen.  Further social support assessment is required.\n\n\n**2. Current Clinical Status:**\n\n* **Primary Complaint:** Persistent cough with hemoptysis.\n* **Physical Examination:**  Significant findings include decreased breath sounds in the right upper lobe, and right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy \u2013 strongly suggestive of lung pathology, potentially malignancy.\n* **Laboratory Results:**  The complete blood count (CBC) shows normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelets, ruling out overt anemia or infection at this time.  Liver function tests (ALT and AST) are mildly elevated, requiring further investigation.  Albumin is within the normal range.  Kidney function (creatinine) is normal.\n\n**3. Relevant Risk Factors:**\n\n* **Age:** 62 years old (increased risk for various cancers).\n* **Gender:** Female (lung cancer incidence is lower in females but increasing).\n* **Smoking History:** Former smoker (significant risk factor for lung cancer).\n* **Symptoms:**  The constellation of symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats) strongly suggests lung cancer.  The location of the lymphadenopathy further supports this suspicion.\n\n\n**4. Performance Status Assessment:**\n\nBased on the presented information, a preliminary assessment suggests a performance status of either ECOG 2 or 3.  The patient is experiencing significant fatigue, weight loss, and decreased appetite, impacting her ability to perform daily activities.  A more detailed assessment using validated tools like the ECOG performance status scale is crucial for accurate staging and treatment planning.\n\n\n**5. Clinical Implications:**\n\nThe clinical presentation strongly suggests the possibility of lung cancer.  The right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy indicates potential advanced disease.  Further investigations are urgently needed:\n\n* **Imaging:**  High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is essential to delineate the extent of the lung lesion and assess for mediastinal involvement.  A chest X-ray should be reviewed if already available.\n* **Bronchoscopy:**  Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and biopsy is needed to obtain tissue for definitive diagnosis and molecular profiling.  This will allow for accurate staging and targeted therapy selection.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) may be necessary for mediastinal lymph node sampling.\n* **PET-CT scan:**  A positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan will be crucial for staging the disease and identifying any distant metastases.\n* **Further Lab Investigations:**  Consider further investigations including CEA, CA 125, and other tumor markers based on the imaging findings.  Repeat liver function tests are warranted.\n\n**Comorbidities Impact on Treatment:** The patient's comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis) need careful consideration when choosing a treatment plan.  The well-controlled nature of her diabetes and hypertension currently does not pose an absolute contraindication to most cancer therapies, but close monitoring will be essential.  Osteoarthritis may influence the tolerability of certain treatments, particularly those with bone marrow suppression side effects.\n\n**Current Medications and Interactions:**  The current medications (Metformin, Lisinopril, PRN NSAIDs) should be reviewed for potential drug interactions with any cancer therapies prescribed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis patient requires urgent further investigation to confirm the diagnosis and stage of the suspected lung cancer.  The multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach involving oncologists, pulmonologists, radiologists, and pathologists is essential for optimal patient management.  A comprehensive treatment plan will be developed based on the definitive diagnosis, stage, and the patient\u2019s overall performance status and comorbidities.  The patient should be counseled about the potential treatment options, risks, and benefits in a patient-centered approach.  This analysis is preliminary and further information is required for a complete assessment."

These guidelines provide recommendations for staging, diagnosis, and treatment of NSCLC, tailored to specific molecular subtypes and disease stages.  Unfortunately, the `guideline_reference` tool is insufficient to directly access and apply these guidelines.  The analysis below will rely on my internal knowledge of these guidelines.",

        "*4. Evidence Levels:**",

        "*5. Clinical Trial Options:**",
        "*6. Treatment Recommendations:**",
        "**First-line treatment:**  Given the KRAS G12C mutation, the current standard of care involves targeted therapy with either sotorasib or adagrasib.  These have demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with this specific mutation.  The choice between sotorasib and adagrasib may depend on specific factors like availability, cost, and potential side-effect profiles.  Both drugs are supported by high-level evidence from phase III clinical trials.",
        "**Combination therapy:**  Depending on response to first-line therapy, combination strategies could be considered.  The combination of a KRAS G12C inhibitor with immunotherapy (e.g., pembrolizumab) is a promising area of research.  This will require careful consideration of the patient's comorbidities and performance status.",
        "**Surgical resection:**  If the final staging demonstrates resectable disease (after EBUS/mediastinoscopy), surgical resection (lobectomy or pneumonectomy) may be an option.  However, this decision should be made cautiously given the patient's comorbidities and the potential risks of major thoracic surgery.  Adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) might be indicated post-surgery depending on final staging and pathological findings.",
        "**Chemoradiotherapy:**  If the disease is unresectable, chemoradiotherapy may be considered, but this would likely be a less preferred option given the availability of targeted therapy.",
        "*7. Special Considerations and Deviations from Standard Practice:**",
        "**Definitive Staging:**  EBUS or mediastinoscopy is crucial to definitively assess nodal status and confirm the stage of the disease.  This is a deviation from standard practice only if not already planned or performed.",
