### Phase 2 Summary & Notes
- All core API endpoints (`/simulate`, `/stream`, `/logs`, `/state`, `/health`) are implemented.
- SSE streaming includes robust reconnection logic based on `Last-Event-ID`.
- Observability endpoints (`/logs`, `/state`) provide basic functionality by filtering structured JSON logs.
- **Potential Issues/Improvements:**
  - The log/state retrieval endpoints perform full file reads and filtering, which will be **inefficient for large log files**. Consider more advanced log aggregation/querying solutions (e.g., ELK stack, dedicated log database) for production scenarios.
  - Agent state retrieval currently relies solely on interpreting log messages. A more structured approach might involve saving specific agent state snapshots to a dedicated store (e.g., the memory system) periodically or on specific events.
  - Error handling in API endpoints is functional but could be enhanced with more specific exception handling and standardized error response schemas.
  - API tests are currently missing and should be added.

## Notes
- All implemented modules follow best practices for testing and error handling
- Configuration and logging modules are ready for use in the rest of the system
- Current implementation provides a solid foundation for the remaining tasks
- Status Update System is now decoupled from LangChain dependencies for better maintainability
- MemoryManager tests have been added but require proper Python path configuration to run
  - Need to set up proper package installation or PYTHONPATH
  - Tests cover all major functionality of the MemoryManager class
  - Implementation follows the same high standards as other modules
- Agent output parsing can be improved for more consistent structured results
- The core multi-agent system is functional, with all agents successfully processing sample data
