# üß† Technical Assignment: Build an AI Agent System

## üßæ Objective

Design and implement an autonomous AI agent system that solves a problem of your choice. The goal is to showcase your ability to build modular, extensible agent systems using code (no UI builders). The system should demonstrate core agent capabilities such as tool use, memory, and autonomous reasoning.

You are free to choose the domain (e.g., research assistant, productivity agent, file automation, game agent, etc.) ‚Äî we're more interested in your approach, system design, and thought process than the specific use case.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Your agent system must include:

### 1. Autonomy

- The agent should be able to reason and act independently toward achieving a goal or solving a task
- Use any agent loop or reasoning pattern (e.g., ReAct, planning, decision trees, custom logic)

### 2. Tool Use

- The agent must be able to call one or more tools or functions to perform specific actions
- Tool calls can be mocked or simulated ‚Äî actual integration is not required

### 3. Memory

- Incorporate memory to help the agent retain context between steps (short-term) or across sessions (long-term)
- The memory should influence behavior in a meaningful way

### 4. Code-Only Implementation

- The system should be built with code (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.) ‚Äî no low-code/no-code tools or UI builders
- Frameworks and libraries are allowed

### 5. Documentation

A README.md that includes:

- The problem you chose to solve
- Your system architecture and reasoning
- Instructions for running the project
- A short reflection on how you used AI assistance (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) during development

## ‚ú® Bonus Points (Optional)

You're encouraged to explore any of the following, but they are not required:

- Multi-agent collaboration
- Persistent or queryable long-term memory
- Retry/fallback logic for tool or LLM failures
- Logging, memory inspection, or agent state debugging
- Self-evaluation or planning simulation
- Custom tool plugin interface

### Extension Thinking

Please consider:

- How you would extend or evolve the agent system
- Features you considered but didn't implement, and why

## üß™ Evaluation Criteria

| Category                | What we look for                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| System Design           | Clear, modular architecture with good separation of concerns         |
| Agent Capabilities      | Proper use of memory, tools, and autonomous reasoning                |
| Code Quality            | Readable, maintainable, and well-structured codebase                 |
| Creativity & Initiative | Thoughtfulness in problem selection and system extensions            |
| Documentation           | Clear explanation of your approach and development process           |
| AI Tool Reflection      | Honest insight into how AI tools helped or didn't help your workflow |

## üì¶ Submission

- A link to a GitHub (or similar) repository
- Include all necessary code, setup instructions, and the README
- A short video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing:
  - System architecture overview
  - Key features demonstration
  - Agent behavior in action
  - Any interesting edge cases or challenges encountered

### Video Requirements

- Maximum duration: 3 minutes
- Should be screen-recorded with audio narration
- Focus on demonstrating the agent's capabilities
- Include a brief walkthrough of the code structure
- Show at least one complete task execution from start to finish

## ‚è± Time Expectation

This assignment is intended to take no more than 4‚Äì6 focused hours. It's fine to leave some ideas as partially implemented or noted in your README ‚Äî we value thoughtful tradeoffs and communication.
